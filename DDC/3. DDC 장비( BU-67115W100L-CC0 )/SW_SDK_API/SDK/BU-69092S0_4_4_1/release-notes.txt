USB_Errata.pdf for all known issues to the BU-65590Ux.

1.  The BU-65590/91U will cause a software crash if the minor frame time in BC
    mode is less than approximately 6ms.

2.  RT may lose messages with RTMTiDemo sample

3.  Ace Test vectors and Protocol test do not operate on E2MA and AceXtreme
    devices.

4.  aceBCStart frame repeat count may execute more than expected.

5.  EMACE Protocol Test Transmits on the Bus.

6.  BU-65590FM does not have software support for External Trigger inputs on
    DIO's.

7.  The BU-67101Q will not work in laptops with Vista unless Microsoft Service
    Pack 1 or Hot Fix 929550 is installed

8.  RTMT demo for the BU-65550M2-602 is not supported.

9.  Under 64-Bit Windows Vista and Windows 7, the DDC Card Manager must be
    run as administrator.  This can be done by right clicking on the DDC
    Card Manager and selecting "Run as Administrator".

10. Error Injection will fail under the following conditions: RT-2-RT
    transmission, where the card is configured to be both RT's, and
    "wrong-bus" MRT error injection is applied.

11. When using Windows Vista or 7 a manual driver update is required.
    The manual driver update can be done via the DDC Card Manager.  The
    manual update is necessary because the device drivers are digital
    signed.

12. When using the DDC Card Manager to update a device driver, the Card
    Manager may show a Not Responding Windows Error message.  The driver
    installation will complete with the Not Responding error.

13. When using the DDC Card Manager to update a device driver, the
    notification of a successful update will be displayed behind the card
    manager.  The user will have to use the ALT+TAB keys to switch to the
    hidden screen to complete the driver update.

14. When installing package version 4.3.1 you may encounter a dialog box that
    says the following: "The setup has detected that version 3.06.015 of BU-69092S0
    AceXtreme C SDK/DDK is already installed. This setup is not compatible with
    this version.  You will have to uninstall the previous version before
    installing this version". To correct issue open the Windows control panel,
    click on programs and uninstall the previously installed DDC AceXtreme
    package.

1. The BU-65590/91U will cause a software crash if the minor frame time in BC
   mode is less than approximately 6ms.

2. RT may lose messages with RTMTiDemo sample

3. Ace Test vectors and Protocol test do not operate on E2MA and AceXtreme
   devices.

4. aceBCStart frame repeat count may execute more than expected.

5. EMACE Protocol Test Transmits on the Bus.

6. BU-65590FM does not have software support for External Trigger inputs on
   DIO's.

7.  The BU-67101Q will not work in laptops with Vista unless Microsoft Service
    Pack 1 or Hot Fix 929550 is installed

8.  RTMT demo for the BU-65550M2-602 is not supported.

9. Under 64-Bit Windows Vista and Windows 7, the DDC Card Manager must be
    run as administrator.  This can be done by right clicking on the DDC
    Card Manager and selecting "Run as Administrator".

10. Intermessage routines for Mode codes are not supported.

11. Error Injection will fail under the following conditions: RT-2-RT
    transmission, where the card is configured to be both RT's, and
    "wrong-bus" MRT error injection is applied.

12. When using Windows Vista or 7 a manual driver update is required.
    The manual driver update can be done via the DDC Card Manager.  The
    manual update is necessary because the device drivers are digital
    signed.

13. When using the DDC Card Manager to update a device driver, the Card
    Manager may show a Not Responding Windows Error message.  The driver
    installation will complete with the Not Responding error.

14. When using the DDC Card Manager to update a device driver, the
    notification of a successful update will be displayed behind the card
    manager.  The user will have to use the ALT+TAB keys to switch to the
    hidden screen to complete the driver update.

15. Using an EMACE based board in RTMT mode with option ACE_RTMT_COMBO_HBUF will
    cause the system to crash once the channel is started.

16. Using an AceXtreme device as an RT will cause the RT to start responding to
    commands before call aceRTStart() or acexMRTStart().


Fixed Defects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  TT-1107 - RT-toRT Broadcast data not recovered from aceRTGetStkMsgDecoded.

2.  TT-1122 - RT-to-BC (Tx) message double buffer implementation in software is
              incomplete.
