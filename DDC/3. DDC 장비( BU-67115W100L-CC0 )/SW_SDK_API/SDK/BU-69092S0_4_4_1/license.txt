materials, and 'online' or electronic documentation ('Product').

YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS SLA BY INSTALLING,

1.  GRANT OF LICENSE. DDC grants you the following rights provided
    that you comply with all terms and conditions of this SLA:


    . Installation and use. You may install, use, access, display
      and run one copy of the Product on a single computer, such as
      a workstation, terminal or other device ('Workstation Computer').
      The Product may not be used in conjunction with non-DDC devices.
      You may not use the Product to permit any Device to use, access,
      display or run other executable software residing on the
      Workstation Computer, nor may you permit any Device to use,
      access, display, or run the Product or Product's user interface,
      unless the Device has a separate license for the Product.

    . Storage/Network Use. You may also store or install a copy of the
      Product on a storage device, such as a network server, used only
      to install or run the Product on your other Workstation Computers
      over an internal network; however, you must acquire and dedicate
      an additional license for each separate Workstation Computer on or
      from which the Product is installed, used, accessed, displayed or
      run. A license for the Product may not be shared or used
      concurrently on different Workstation Computers.

    . Reservation of Rights. DDC reserves all rights not expressly
      granted to you in this SLA.

3.  TRANSFER. You may move the Product to a different Workstation
    Computer. After the transfer, you must completely remove the Product
